### Background
A mid-sized retail business, ShopEase, operates an online store where customers can make 
purchases using various payment methods. To understand discrepancies in transaction fees 
and to streamline customer experiences, ShopEase partnered with a payment processor that 
provides detailed transaction data.

### Key Concepts:
1.  Business Name: This field captures the name of the businesses involved in the transactions. It allows us to categorize and identify key participants.
2.  User Type: Differentiates between user categories such as customers, merchants, or system users, giving insights into transaction flow between different actors.
3.  Reference & Unique Identifier: These fields can help track individual transactions, allowing for traceability and auditing.
4.  Amount: This is the transaction value, which helps us evaluate overall monetary flow.
5.  Service Fees (General, Banker, Customer): These indicate fees associated with the transaction from different perspectives.
6.  Transaction Type: Determines whether itâ€™s a payment, refund, or other kinds of transactions, providing more context.
7.  Status: Provides information on whether the transaction is successful, pending, or failed.
8.  Card Type, Masked PAN, Card Description: Offers details about the payment method used, critical for understanding consumer preferences.

### Problem
The project looks at the impact of various service fee structures on user behavior

### Analysis Process
### ETL Process for Transaction Data Analysis
In this case study, we follow the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to analyze transaction 
data, using various tools such as RStudio, PostgreSQL, and Power BI to create insightful reports.

### Step 1: Extract Data
The first step in the ETL process involves extracting the raw transaction data 
from a CSV files.

### Step 2: Transform Data
Once the data is extracted, the next step is to clean and transform the data for analysis.
Transformation Code is attached 


##### Step 3: Load Data
Once the data is transformed, it needs to be loaded into PostgreSQL for storage and further 
reporting. The transformed data is sent to a PostgreSQL database using RStudio's database 
connection libraries such as RPostgres.


##### Step 4: Reporting with Power BI
With the transformed data now stored in PostgreSQL, the final step is to create reports and visualizations using Power BI. Power BI connects directly to the PostgreSQL database using the PostgreSQL connector.

Connect Power BI to PostgreSQL: Use the native PostgreSQL connector in Power BI to access the data.

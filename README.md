### Background
A mid-sized retail business, ShopEase, operates an online store where customers can make 
purchases using various payment methods. To understand discrepancies in transaction fees 
and to streamline customer experiences, ShopEase partnered with a payment processor that 
provides detailed transaction data.

#### Key Concepts:
1.  Business Name: This field captures the name of the businesses involved in the transactions. It allows us to categorize and identify key participants.
2.  User Type: Differentiates between user categories such as customers, merchants, or system users, giving insights into transaction flow between different actors.
3.  Reference & Unique Identifier: These fields can help track individual transactions, allowing for traceability and auditing.
4.  Amount: This is the transaction value, which helps us evaluate overall monetary flow.
5.  Service Fees (General, Banker, Customer): These indicate fees associated with the transaction from different perspectives.
6.  Transaction Type: Determines whether itâ€™s a payment, refund, or other kinds of transactions, providing more context.
7.  Status: Provides information on whether the transaction is successful, pending, or failed.
8.  Card Type, Masked PAN, Card Description: Offers details about the payment method used, critical for understanding consumer preferences.

#### Problem
The impact of various service fee structures on user behavior

#### Analysis Process
##### ETL Process for Transaction Data Analysis
In this case study, we follow the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to analyze transaction 
data, using various tools such as RStudio, PostgreSQL, and Power BI to create insightful reports.

##### Step 1: Extract Data
The first step in the ETL process involves extracting the raw transaction data 
from a CSV files.

##### Step 2: Transform Data
Once the data is extracted, the next step is to clean and transform the data for analysis. This process in RStudio might involve:

Case Story for Transaction Analysis
Background
A mid-sized retail business, ShopEase, operates an online store where customers can make purchases using various payment methods. To understand discrepancies in transaction fees and to streamline customer experiences, ShopEase partnered with a payment processor that provides detailed transaction data.

Transaction Summary
In one instance, a transaction was made by a customer (User Type: Customer) identified with a unique identifier, CUS12345. The customer made a purchase of $500, recorded as the Amount. The data provided included the following key components:

Service Fees: The transaction incurred a Service Fee of $10, a Banker Service Fee of $5, and a Customer Service Fee of $2.
Transaction Type: This was identified as a Purchase.
Card Information: The customer used a credit card ending in 1234 (Masked PAN) of type Visa (Card Type).
Terminal Details: Transaction was processed through Terminal ID TID67890.
Reference Numbers: Transaction references such as RRN (Retrieval Reference Number) and STAN (System Trace Audit Number) were provided to track the transaction.
Status: The transaction was marked as Successful.
Issues Identified
During the analysis, the discrepancy noted was the higher-than-expected service fees. Additionally, confusion arose due to separate listings for the banker and customer service fees. ShopEase raised concerns about the transparency and the clear breakdown of costs associated with each transaction.

Resolution Path
ShopEase sought clarification from the payment processor to confirm how the service fees were calculated. They requested a detailed breakdown of the fee structure linked to the BILLER_ID and sought to renegotiate the terms for reducing costs.

Conclusion
By analyzing this data, ShopEase identified hidden costs affecting its profitability and took proactive steps to resolve the issue, ultimately enhancing its transaction processing strategy.

ETL Process for Transaction Data Analysis
In this case study, we follow the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to analyze transaction data, using various tools such as RStudio, PostgreSQL, and Power BI to create insightful reports.

Step 1: Extract Data
The first step in the ETL process involves extracting the raw transaction data from a source, such as CSV files, databases, or APIs provided by the payment processor. In our example, we extract transaction data from a CSV file or API that contains key information such as:

Business Name
User Type
Reference
Unique Identifier
Amount
Service Fees (Service Fee, Banker Service Fee, Customer Service Fee)
Card Information (Masked PAN, Card Type)
Transaction Type, Status, and Timestamps
In RStudio, the data extraction would typically be performed with the following steps:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)

# Extract transaction data from a CSV file
transaction_data <- read_csv("path_to_transaction_data.csv")

# View the first few rows of data
head(transaction_data)
Step 2: Transform Data
Once the data is extracted, the next step is to clean and transform the data for analysis. This process in RStudio might involve:

Handling missing data
Calculating new variables like total service fees
Filtering out irrelevant or failed transactions
Changing data types (e.g., converting dates, formatting numeric fields)
Aggregating data for reporting purposes, such as calculating the total service fees per transaction or per user.
Example of data transformation using R:

R
Copy code
# Clean and transform the data
library(dplyr)

# Calculate total service fees and filter successful transactions
transformed_data <- transaction_data %>%
  filter(Status == "Successful") %>%
  mutate(Total_Service_Fee = Service_Fee + Banker_Service_Fee + Customer_Service_Fee) %>%
  select(Business_Name, User_Type, Unique_Identifier, Amount, Total_Service_Fee, Date, Card_Type)

# View transformed data
head(transformed_data)
Step 3: Load Data
Once the data is transformed, it needs to be loaded into PostgreSQL for storage and further reporting. The transformed data is sent to a PostgreSQL database using RStudio's database connection libraries such as RPostgres.

Steps to load data into PostgreSQL:

Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
Write the transformed data to a specific table for reporting.
R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries for PostgreSQL connection
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres)

# Connect to PostgreSQL database
con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), 
                 dbname = "transaction_db",
                 host = "your_host",
                 port = 5432,
                 user = "your_username",
                 password = "your_password")

# Write transformed data to PostgreSQL table
dbWriteTable(con, "transformed_transactions", transformed_data, overwrite = TRUE)

# Disconnect from the database
dbDisconnect(con)


##### Step 4: Reporting with Power BI
With the transformed data now stored in PostgreSQL, the final step is to create reports and visualizations using Power BI. Power BI connects directly to the PostgreSQL database using the PostgreSQL connector.

Connect Power BI to PostgreSQL: Use the native PostgreSQL connector in Power BI to access the data.
